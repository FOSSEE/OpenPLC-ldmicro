    COMMENT This only works with a cycle time of 10 ms. If we want the delay to be between 0 s and 5 s,\r\nthen it should be 0 to 500 cycle times; the ADC goes from 0 to 1023, so (roughly) divide by 2.

    COMMENT Then just hook up the input and the output of the timer to pins. Of course\r\nthat could drive more complicated logic, not just a pin on the processor.
