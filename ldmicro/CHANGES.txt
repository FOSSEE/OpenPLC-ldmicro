
== Release 2.2

    * Fix a problem with the ANSI C target when the program had bit and
      integer variables with the same name. Note that this changes the
      names of the symbols in the generated C program; so a system that
      uses "magic variables" with this target for I/O must be updated
      to use the new names.

    * Fix a subtle bug in the PIC16 add and subtract routines, where 
      operations of the form B = A - B could fail.

    * The piecewise linear tables were broken for the AVRs; fix that.

== Release 2.1

    * For the AVR UARTs, poll UDRE instead of TXC. The formatted string op
      was broken on some targets, should now be fixed.

    * Don't draw selected op in bold font; that looks ugly under Vista.

== Release 2.0
    
    * Add PIC16F886 and PIC16F887 targets.

    * Fix display bug in the list to select an I/O pin.

    * Fix bug where PIC16 UART locks up forever after a framing error when
      the cycle time is faster than one byte time.

    * Fix bug where PIC16 outputs could briefly glitch high at startup.

    * Clear PCLATH in PIC16 boot vector, since some bootloaders expect that.

== Release 1.9

    * Modify PIC16 boot vectors to work with many bootloaders.

== Release 1.8

    * Fix modification of a constant string that blew up in new MSVC++
      compiler.

    * Add Italian, Turkish, Portuguese.

== Release 1.7

    * Make the source compile with latest version of MSVC++; overloaded
      functions behave a bit differently.

    * Recover from (and ignore) UART errors on the PIC16 target, instead
      of getting stuck forever.

    * Whenever contacts bound to an output pin (Yfoo) were edited, they
      reverted to an input pin (Xfoo); now fixed.

    * Don't abort on too-wide program; instead display nice message.

    * It was possible (by adding and deleting contacts/coils with the
      same name) to end up with two bit variables bound to the same
      physical I/O pin; now fixed.

    * File -> Open was correct, but Ctrl+O failed to ask about unsaved
      changes before opening requested file; now both are correct.

    * Add Spanish user interface strings.

== Release 1.6

    * Internationalize the user interface strings; we now have versions
      in English, French, and German.

    * First source release, under the GPLv3.

== Release 1.5

    * Add untested support for ATmega32.

    * Remove annoying lag in user interface when editing large (hundreds
      of ops) programs

== Release 1.4

    * Fix a terrible bug in the target for the ATmega8; because there is
      no PORTA/DDRA/PINA, I broke an assumption in my code and failed
      to set up the port directions.

== Release 1.3

    * Timer delays are represented as a signed 32-bit integer count
      of microseconds. If the user provides a delay >= 2**31 us, then
      show an error instead of just letting things wrap.

    * Change the start-up behaviour of TOF timers. Previously they would
      start from a count of zero, so they would be on (independent of
      rung-in) until they counted themselves off. Now they start out
      at full count (as if rung-in has been low for a very long time),
      so rung-out is low until rung-in goes high.

== Release 1.2

    * Add an untested target for the ATmega8

    * Add a special instruction to simplify piecewise linear tables

    * Fix some user interface bugs: it was possible to drag the top of the
      I/O list so high that you couldn't grab it again, and there were
      some cases in which the pin number associated with UART and PWM
      variables was not displayed

== Release 1.1

    * Fix persistent variables, which were broken for the PIC16F628

== Release 1.0

    * Fix bug in which the filename that appears in the title bar of the
      main window failed to get updated when opening/saving a file using
      the keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl+O/+S)

    * Fix simulation crash when the ladder logic program divides by zero

    * Fix jumpy scrolling on programs with many rungs of logic when the
      cursor is off-screen

== Release 0.9

    * Fix bug with formatted string op on the AVR
    * Fix previously-untested ATmega16 and ATmega162 targets, which were
      completely broken

=== Release 0.8

    * Fix PORTA on the PIC16F819 (came up assigned to ADCs, of course)

=== Release 0.7

    * Support arbitrary character (\xAB) escapes in formatted string op
    * Fix a bug in which the title bar of the main window was not updated

=== Release 0.6

    * Add formatted text output over serial (e.g. to an LCD or a PC)
    * Add ability to make variables persistent (i.e. auto-saved in EEPROM)
    * Add look-up table instructions
    * Fix a bug with the PORTE pins on some AVRs
    * Fix miscellaneous user interface bugs

=== Release 0.5

    * Interpretable byte code target
    * Shift register and master control relay instructions

=== Release 0.4

    * Make ADCs work on the AVRs

=== Release 0.3

    * Support serial for AVR
    * Support PWM for PIC16 and AVR
    * Show program filename in title bar of main window
    * Untested support for PIC16F88, F819, F876
    * Generate ANSI C code from ladder diagram

=== Release 0.2

    * Support serial communications (using UART), PIC16 only
    * Support ADC reads, PIC16 only
    * Simulation environment for ADC and serial
    * Support ASCII character constant ('a') literals
    * Fix PORTA pins in PIC16F628 (should assign as GPIO, not to comparator)
    * Make file open/save dialogs work under Win98
    * Fix PORTA/PORTE pins in PIC16F877 (should assign as GPIO, not to ADC)
    * Add ability to comment your program
    * Fix bug when a relative filename is given on the command line and
      the `Compile As' dialog is later used to specify a destination in
      a different directory
